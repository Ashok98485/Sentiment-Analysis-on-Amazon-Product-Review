# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Amazon-Product-Review
Goal of project:
- Perform Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Product Review to predict positive or negative reviews

Result:
- With the base table built from dictionary, n-gram and TFIDF, we have explored 5 machine learning models – Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, Neural Network and Decision Tree. 
- Out of the 5 models, Support Vector Machine has provided us with the highest accuracy of 0.976 and a low false positive rate of 0.0288. - Neural Network has similar performance with a slightly lower accuracy of 0.973 but a lower false positive rate of 0.0255.
